# CoacervateMD
A repo for Chemistry Research Methods Curtin: Molecular simulation of the self-aggregation of coacervates

benchmarkMagnus exists as the HPC Magnus did not easily load MDBenchmark (python3): instruction is clear and benchmarkMagnus exists as a final product

correlatedmotion is an attempt at writing a script for principal component analysis: it has been abandoned due to poor results and the existence of Gromacs dihedral principal component analysis

makenew creates new simulations, it is very simple and can be altered easily

minimisation is an automatic minimisation script: it stores files in one line, to view these files with formating please check out greifm/publicrepo. instruction is clear and exists as a semi-final product. requires further testing; so far being tested on three systems

postprocessing and postprocessingions are very loose, ugly, uncommented scripts: they exist purely for reference if there is any confusion in the methodology

a final report will be added at some point and will give context to this repo
